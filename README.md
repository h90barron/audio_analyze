A collection of scripts I've created to test out different  techniques of audio analysis. These are all still in development and for the most part only work for testing purposes. The goal is to find the right technique (or more likely combination of techniques) of analysis that allows for human intuitive visualizations. Currently I'm working towards a combination of freqeuncy binning and amplitude spike analysis (within each bin). For complex signals (like music) this should examine each layer of the sound and identify the pulses within each layer.
